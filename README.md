# binary_trees

a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A rooted binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children.<br>
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper plane, or strict binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Another way of defining a full binary tree is a recursive definition. A full binary tree is either<br>
    -A single vertex (a single node as the root node).<br>
    -A tree whose root node has two subtrees, both of which are full binary trees
